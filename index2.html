    <p2> Comparative Literature studies literature across national, cultural, and linguistic borders. The international and comparative range of the  discipline provides students a broad critical understanding of what literature is and does. Since knowing the language is essential to understanding a given literature and culture, all majors study a second language and literature at an advanced level. At the same time, the study of works in translation, especially those originally written in non-European languages, provokes cross-cultural comparisons and helps prepare students for a multilingual, pluralistic, and global world. Comparison of literature to other kinds of arts, media, and writing further extends understanding of literature and culture. Two programs of study are offered: the Major in Comparative Literature and the Major in Comparative Arts.</p2>
    <h4> <b> A Major in Comparative Literature Offers Many Possibilities </b> </h4>
    <p2> Comparative Literature majors find internships and jobs--in the United States and abroad--where they do research, write and edit, or teach, while gaining experience and learning about fields as diverse as the environment and the record industry.</p2>
    <p2>Majors in Comparative Literature can enter degree programs in professional fields including Journalism, Law, Librarianship, and Business. You can study Education, to become certified to teach literature or languages in a high school. Or you can pursue a graduate degree in Comparative Literature or a national literature in preparation for a career in teaching and research at a college or university, in a language and literature, Comparative Literature, or English department.</p2>
